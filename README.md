## Your fantastic heros here

This is a website for football teams to begin their journey in the world of football. You can build your club and add the players you want to your team. This project uses React and TypeScript and is not completed yet. There is a awesome search feature I really love.

## [My Live site: https://boring-noyce-e5c9a9.netlify.app/](https://boring-noyce-e5c9a9.netlify.app/)

My project includes:

1. [React.js](https://reactjs.org/),
2. [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/),
3. [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/getting-started/introduction/) and
4. [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

#### Road Map:

=> adding more sections to the homepage\
=> making a backend\
=> making things dynamic\
=> adding "contact us" page\
=> making it possible to have virtual money and a real team
